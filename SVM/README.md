The three code files are for SVM practice.

For this section,

Q2a's code is HW4Part22a.py[you can set C in line 15] 
Q2b's code is HW4Part22b.py[you can set C in line 14]
Q3a's code is HW4Part23a.py[you can set C as a bound in line 45]


You can see I have also attached the training and testing files. 

test1.csv and train1.csv are for Q2a.
test2.csv and train2.csv are for Q2b.
test3.csv and train3.csv are for Q3a.

If you do 'python3 filename' in the CADE machines, the output matches the output I have written down in my HW file. Please make sure
that the training files and the testing files are in the same directory as python files.
