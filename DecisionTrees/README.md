The three code files are for the section: 'Decision Tree Practice'

For this section,

Q2a's code is DTP2A.py [Please specify depth for training in line 284 and depth for testing in line 316]
Q3a's code is DTP3A.py [Please specify depth for training in line 351 and depth for testing in line 395]
Q3b's code is DTP3B.py [Please specify depth for training in line 382 and depth for testing in line 430]

You can see I have also attached the training and testing files. 

Test1.csv and Train1.csv are for Q2a.

Test.csv and Train.csv are for Q3a and Q3b.

If you do 'python3 filename' in the CADE machines, the output matches the output I have written down in my HW file. Please make sure
that the training files and the testing files are in the same directory as python files.
