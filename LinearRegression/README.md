The three code files are Linear Regression.

For this section,

Q4a's code is HW2Part24a.py 
Q4b's code is HW2Part24b.py 
Q4c's code is HW2Part24c.py

You can see I have also attached the training and testing files. 

Test.csv and Train.csv are used in all the code files.

If you do 'python3 filename' in the CADE machines, the output matches the output I have written down in my HW file. Please make sure
that the training files and the testing files are in the same directory as python files.
