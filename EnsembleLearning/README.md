The three code files are for Ensemble Learning.

For this section,

Q2a's code is HW2Part22a.py 
Q2b's code is HW2Part22b.py 
Q2d's code is HW2Part22d.py

You can see I have also attached the training and testing files. 

Test1.csv and Train1.csv are for Q2a.

Test.csv and Train.csv are for Q2b and Q2d.

If you do 'python3 filename' in the CADE machines, the output matches the output I have written down in my HW file. Please make sure
that the training files and the testing files are in the same directory as python files.
