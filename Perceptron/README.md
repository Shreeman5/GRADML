The three code files are for Perceptron.

For this section,

Q2a's code is HW3Part22a.py 
Q2b's code is HW3Part22b.py 
Q2c's code is HW3Part22c.py

You can see I have also attached the training and testing files. 

Test.csv and Train.csv are for Q2a, Q2b and Q2c.

If you do 'python3 filename' in the CADE machines, the output matches the output I have written down in my HW file. Please make sure
that the training files and the testing files are in the same directory as python files.
