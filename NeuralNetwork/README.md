The three code files are for Neural Netowrk.

For the coding section of the homework,

Q2a's code is HW5Part22a.py 
Q2b's code is HW2Part22b.py 
Q2c's code is HW2Part22c.py

You can see I have also attached the training and testing files. 

test.csv and train.csv are used for HW5Part22b. test1.csv and train1.csv are used for HW5Part22c. 

If you do 'python3 filename' in the CADE machines, the training and the testing error matches what I have written down in my HW file. 
Please make sure that the training files and the testing files are in the same directory as the python files.


HW5Part22a.py will confirm the weights I got for Q3 of the paper problem. Please see my HW file to know how to interpret the output. I 
have given detailed instructions there.

In HW5Part22b.py and HW5Part22c.py, you can set T at line 93, initial learning rate at line 91, d_val at line 92 and width at line 156.
